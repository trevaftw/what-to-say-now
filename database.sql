Try one, try them all – it’s up to you. Do what feels right for you andfeels relatable to the ages you coach.\n\n•  Model positive self-talk with your athletes. Avoid saying negative things about your own body, your appearance, or others’ bodies in front of your athletes.\n\n• Listen for comments your athletes may make about their bodies, such as negative comments about their own size or shape, or teasing others (even as “good-natured” fun). Step in to say “healthy bodies come in all shapes and sizes;think of ways your body helps you play [your sport] well.” (Depending on the setting and the athletes involved, you may decide to say it to a group, or more quietly to an individual.)\n\n•  At the beginning or the end of practice, bring your athletes together and tell them that you want them to know appreciating their own bodies is an important part of being a good athlete. You could start by saying how you value that they each are unique, and that healthy athletes come in all shapes and sizes. You could acknowledge that maybe they’ve seen images of athletes or watched a professional sporting event and compared themselves to an athlete that they think is “perfect.” Encourage them to focus on appreciating their own bodies, and invite them to think about or share how their body helps them play their sport well. You can remind them that overemphasizing appearance or trying to change their body shape/size ultimately will detract from their performance.\n\nGood luck with this challenge!

Focusing on how food helps our brains and bodies grow, think, move and keep us fueled throughout the day helps athletes see food as beneficial for playing their sport. It also helps take the focus off food in relation to body size or weight andkeep it on how food creates energy for our minds and bodies to play well.\n\n Different foods, all in moderation, have different nutritional benefits that our minds and bodies need to feel balanced and healthy, thereby allowing us to perform at ourbest. Research suggests that adults’ beliefs and judgements about food can impact a child’s thoughts and eating behaviors. If adults are labeling food choices as “good/bad” or “clean/unhealthy”, it can equate food with stress or anxiety about being right or wrong. It also can cause stress for kids who live with food insecurity. When we focus on communicating about variety and balance, it helps athletes see different foods as positive to their growth, their strength and their performance, andvalue what it can do for them.',E'Think about your own relationship to food. Do you think of food as fuel and energy for getting through your day, or do you think more about food in relation to body size or weight? Do you label or judge foods often? Do you talk about foods in extremes (“never eat this” or “always eat this”)? Think about how your attitudes might be reflected in communication with your athletes.',E'Below are suggested action steps you can take with your athletes as you coach them this week. Try one or both. Do what feels right for you and feels relatable to the ages you coach.\n\n•  Model non-judgmental thoughts and beliefs towards food with your athletes. Avoid talking about food in terms such as good/bad, clean/junk, healthy/unhealthy. Emphasize that balance and variety are what’s needed, not restriction. If you or someone else brings snacks for practice or a game, don’t refer to them as rewards.  \n\n•  Listen to how your athletes talk about food, whether they’re talking about their favorite snack, what they had for lunch, or what they’re having for dinner. If you hear them make comments about food in relation to body size or weight, try to redirect them. You can tell them that “All food is fuel, and your body needs fuel to perform its best during practice or a game” or “Food is energy. You’ll play better when you have energy.”\n\n• At the end of practice, bring your athletes together and ask them how they felt during practice. Tired? Energized? Hungry? Remind them that food helps them grow and gives their bodies energy to play their best. Everyone is different, so different foods might fuel athletes in different ways. Ask them to think about what foods help them feel best for playing their sport, but don’t make judgementcomments about their responses as right/wrong or good/bad.\n\nGood luck with this next challenge!

Your ability to [insert specific attribute] makes us a better team.”',E'Research has shown that coaches’ assessments of ability and intention in young athletes are important factors in the development of positive self-esteem. In relation to healthy food and body attitudes, kids who are confident and feel good about themselves are less likely to developunhealthy eating patterns and body dissatisfaction. You can build self-esteem in your athletes by praising their uniqueness, work ethic and skills. This helps take the focus off appearance, weightor other factors that can be harmful to how they view themselves.',E'Think about your athletes and the unique qualities they each have that you admire and/or respect. Think about what each athlete adds to your team/sport.

Try one or both. Do what feels right for you and feels relatable to the ages you coach.\n\n• Celebrate each athlete on your team by telling them what you appreciate about them and/or why they are unique to the team. You could do this individually with them (“You’re really good at passing the ball, which is important for us to play well as a team.”), or call it out when you see it happening. (“Great effort on that play – I love how you always try so hard!”)\n\n•  Engage your team in an uplifting, encouraging team-bonding activity. Have each athlete write their name on the top of a sheet of paper and then have your athletes pass their paper around to everyone else. Each athlete will write one positive thing they value about the athlete whose name is written at the top. Once everyone has had a chance to write something about everyone on the team, collect the sheets and pass them out to the athletes they belong to.
